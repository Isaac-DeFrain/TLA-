Computing initial states...
Finished computing initial states: 1 distinct state generated at 2021-03-13 16:09:42.
Progress(7) at 2021-03-13 16:09:42: 23 states generated, 17 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
Checking 8 branches of temporal properties for the complete state space with 136 total distinct states at (2021-03-13 16:09:42)
Finished checking temporal properties in 00s at 2021-03-13 16:09:42
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 5.5E-18
23 states generated, 17 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 7.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 2 and the 95th percentile is 2).
