Computing initial states...
Finished computing initial states: 1 distinct state generated at 2021-03-15 01:22:06.
Progress(11) at 2021-03-15 01:22:12: 1,866,963 states generated (1,866,963 s/min), 211,233 distinct states found (211,233 ds/min), 102,841 states left on queue.
Progress(11) at 2021-03-15 01:22:15: 4,043,521 states generated, 248,832 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
Checking 2 branches of temporal properties for the complete state space with 497664 total distinct states at (2021-03-15 01:22:15)
Finished checking temporal properties in 01s at 2021-03-15 01:22:16
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 5.1E-8
  based on the actual fingerprints:  val = 1.1E-9
4043521 states generated, 248832 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 11.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 31 and the 95th percentile is 8).
