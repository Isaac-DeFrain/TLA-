Computing initial states...
Finished computing initial states: 1 distinct state generated at 2021-03-16 21:41:35.
Progress(7) at 2021-03-16 21:41:51: 279,231 states generated (279,231 s/min), 78,906 distinct states found (78,906 ds/min), 68,432 states left on queue.
Progress(8) at 2021-03-16 21:41:56: 4,043,521 states generated, 248,832 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
Checking 2 branches of temporal properties for the complete state space with 497664 total distinct states at (2021-03-16 21:41:56)
Finished checking temporal properties in 02s at 2021-03-16 21:41:59
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 5.1E-8
  based on the actual fingerprints:  val = 2.2E-9
4043521 states generated, 248832 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 8.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 31 and the 95th percentile is 9).
