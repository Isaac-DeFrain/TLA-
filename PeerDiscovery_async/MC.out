Checking 6 branches of temporal properties for the complete state space with 2227758 total distinct states at (2021-03-22 23:14:07)
Finished checking temporal properties in 04s at 2021-03-22 23:14:11
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 2.7E-8
  based on the actual fingerprints:  val = 2.8E-9
1713661 states generated, 371293 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 11.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 31 and the 95th percentile is 11).
