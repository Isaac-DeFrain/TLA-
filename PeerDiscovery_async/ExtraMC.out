Finished computing initial states: 1 distinct state generated at 2021-03-22 23:22:41.
Progress(10) at 2021-03-22 23:22:47: 532,228 states generated (532,228 s/min), 104,674 distinct states found (104,674 ds/min), 73,705 states left on queue.
Progress(12) at 2021-03-22 23:23:08: 5,712,201 states generated, 371,293 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
Checking 7 branches of temporal properties for the complete state space with 2599051 total distinct states at (2021-03-22 23:23:08)
Finished checking temporal properties in 05s at 2021-03-22 23:23:13
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 1.1E-7
  based on the actual fingerprints:  val = 1.9E-8
5712201 states generated, 371293 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 12.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 31 and the 95th percentile is 11).
